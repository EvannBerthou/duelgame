- Server side cooldown
- Check server side that moves are valid
- Clients should not include their ID in packet sent because it allows anyone to send any action as someone else
- Some kind of runes or stats customization ?
- Better battle logging (in-game recap ?)
- Make game window resizable
- pkt_* functions should return a net_packet with content set from a malloc. It will allow us to buffer packets that 
    need to be sent when multithreading will be implemented
- 3 player game are bugged because you can still play when you are dead
- Generic queue

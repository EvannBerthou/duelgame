- Reduce draw calls
- Save and load builds
    - Exists but extra janky
- Implement remaining spells
- Particule system
- Infos are kinda ugly
- Moving should be an animation just like spell casting
    - Animations should include a path instead of just a cell
- Map editor

- Anti-cheat
    - Check server side that moves are valid
    - Server side cooldown on spells
    - Clients should not include their ID in packet sent because it allows anyone to send any action as someone else

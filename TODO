    - Atlas ?
- Reorganise assets folder

- Ligthing
- Background animations
- In game UI should move when game is resized (avoid having big gap at the top and bottom of the game)
- Reduce draw calls
- Save and load builds
- Weird animations at the end of the round when 1 burn + 2 target
- Implement remaining spells
- Particule system
- Infos are kinda ugly

- Anti-cheat
    - Check server side that moves are valid
    - Server side cooldown on spells
    - Clients should not include their ID in packet sent because it allows anyone to send any action as someone else

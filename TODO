- Server side cooldown
- Check server side that moves are valid
- Clients should not include their ID in packet sent because it allows anyone to send any action as someone else
- Some kind of runes or stats customization ?
- Better battle logging
- Make game window resizable
- Bugged when we target the same player twice in a round
- pkt_* functions should return a net_packet with content set from a malloc. It will allow us to buffer packets that 
    need to be sent when multithreading will be implemented
- Loops should not be based on player count because if someone disconnected it will not be right

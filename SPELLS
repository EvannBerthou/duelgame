Spell ideas

Offensive spells :

- Burn => Fixed damage X
- Poison => % remanining health scaling damage
- Ice => Damage + reduces target speed
- Sacrify => Dies but deals lot of damage around you. Can be blocked
- Focus => Increases next spell damage. Has a 1 turn action cooldown

Defensive spells :

- Blocking => If casted first, will block the next attack. If the ennemy hits with a physical attack, he will be stunned. Has low speed by default so it needs some setup (more speed on stats or other bonuses)
- Knockback => Pushed the player. If he hits an obstacle he is stunned
- Cleanse => Removes all effects
- Banish => Target can't use last spell until the end of the round. Can only be used once per round.
    - If casted first, it will ban the spell used in the previous turn (or any previous turn)
    - If casted second, it will ban the sell used during the turn
- Revert => If casted first does nothing. If casted second, cancels last recieved damage and sends some to the caster.

Stat spells :

- Fortify => Increases max health by 15HP
- Slow down => Reduces the speed of the target until the end of the round
- Speed boost => Increase the speed of the next spell

Movement spells :

- Move => Normal move with medium range
- Slow move => more range but slow
- Dash => Fast move but low range
- Dodge => moves only if the player is hit by a spell. Avoids damage. If no damage, does nothing

Stats ideas

- Crit chance => crit damage every X turn on a spell based on much points given into the stat. 
    - 1 point => Every turn but 105% damage. 2 points => 3 turn but 115% damage, etc..
    - 1 point could consume 10 stat points
    - The counter increments even if the player does a non-damage spell (such as a move)
    - It forces the player to decide if he wants to use his crit now or wait for the next opportunity
- Speed => Increase all spells speed. Has a base of 0 but can be negative. Should it give more points ?
    - Enables low speed builds

To implements :

Focus
Sacrify => Implement ST_AROUND
Block
Banish
Revert
Knockback => Need to compute the direction
